We utilize services within our controllers; however, the main logic is created in the services. In the controllers, we incorporate these services and add additional logic depending on our specific requirements.

Yes, your understanding is correct. In an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with services, the separation of concerns is key, and it typically works like this:

Services
Primary Role: Services contain the core business logic and operations of your application. This includes interactions with the database (like CRUD operations), processing data, handling complex calculations, and communicating with external APIs.
Independence: Services are designed to be independent of the web layer (HTTP requests and responses). They focus on performing specific tasks and operations.
Reusability: Since services are not tied to specific requests or responses, they can be reused across different parts of your application, including various controllers.
Controllers
Primary Role: Controllers act as an intermediary between the client (user) and the application (services and models). They handle incoming HTTP requests, process them by using the appropriate services, and send back HTTP responses.
Request-Response Cycle: Controllers are directly involved in the web layer. They parse request data, decide which service methods to call based on the request, and then format and send the response (often using the data returned from services).
Additional Logic: Controllers might include additional logic that is specific to the web layer, like validating request data, setting HTTP status codes, and deciding the structure of the response.
Example Workflow:
HTTP Request: A client sends an HTTP request to the server.
Controller Handling: The request hits a controller route. The controller parses the request data and possibly performs initial validations or transformations.
Service Interaction: The controller calls the appropriate service method(s) to perform the desired operation. This could involve querying the database, processing data, etc.
Response Formation: Once the service completes its task and returns data (if any), the controller uses this data to form an HTTP response, which might include setting the correct status code and formatting the data.
HTTP Response: The controller sends the response back to the client.
Conclusion:
Controllers are about managing the flow of data in the request-response cycle and ensuring the correct use of services based on the client's requests.
Services are about the core application logic, independent of how the data is presented to or received from the user.
This architecture promotes a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase, where each part of the system has a clear and distinct role.
